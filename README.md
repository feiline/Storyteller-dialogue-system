# Storyteller Dialogue System

Conversational AI: MSc project to design and build a conversational story-teller dialogue system.

## Installation
The system is developed and tested using Python 3.7. Some of the libraries required are:
- DM `nltk`
- NLG ``
- NLU `rasa, tensorFlow, re`
- bot `telepot, flask, logging, argparser`
- fsm `transitions`
- web interface ``

### Run the application
- install the requirements in requirements.txt
- Create a Telegram bot following the steps given by the BotFather bot in Telegram (you can follow this tutorial: https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) 
- Modify the credentials.py file with your bot name and bot token
- Registered to Ngrok from https://ngrok.com/
- Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started to download the ngrok client
- Unzip the folder
- From the unzipped folder, run the command ./ngrok authtoken xxxxxxxxxxxxxxas that appears for you on that link
- Run ./ngrok http 5130
- Replace the bot.setWebhook("https://******.ngrok.io/chat") in bot.py with the https url generated by ngrok (leave /chat at the end)

Now you should be able to run the application using your new Telegram bot as interface by running bot.py.

### Change DM policy
In bot.py you can select which DM policy to use.
Currently the system uses the baseline strategy. To use the Feedback Prompt strategy please comment line 102 of bot.py and uncomment line 103 of bot.py
