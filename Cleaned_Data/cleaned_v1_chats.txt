	Hi
Storyteller:
	On Monday morning me and Anne went down to the worlds biggest fish market, Tsujiki Fish market for the early morning auction. We got there at 6:30 am.m and we were too late because there were no signs posted in Romanji.
Storyteller:
	We weren't the only ones who were there either. Some people got there before we did and none of them made it to the auction either.
User:
	Im sorry you missed the fresh fish for the day. Perhaps you can learn some Romanji to Engoish words.
User:
	They must not have had much to sell
User:
	Perhaps go an hour earlier next time and you might get some fish.
Storyteller:
	According to the guidebook the auction is open to the trade. It was quite the experience to see hundreds of people with their goods, including tuna hauling them back and forth to sell. SOme of them had small delivery carts too. The tuna didn't have any tailed and they were in their mouths so they could save space.
User:
	Tuna are really large fish so i can see why they would need a cart to move them around
User:
	Did the market sell any special fish you hadnt heard of before?
User:
	Did you see and sushi chefs there buying the fresh fish for their restaurants? I bet they go there very early to get what they need for their sushi.
User:
	Is Anne your sister? Is she here for a visit?
User:
	I went to the fish market one time with my grandfather when I was a little girl. He carried me on his shoulders the entire time so my new suede boots didnt get a fishy smell .
Storyteller:
	I took a lot of pictures
User:
	You should post some of them so we can see what the market looks like today.

	Why did the cut the goose open?
User:
	I dont know why did they?
Storyteller:
	They thought they would get a lot of gold
User:
	Did they find any?
Storyteller:
	No it was just like any other goose sadly
User:
	oh thats sad
Storyteller:
	Yeah they should have just accepted one golden egg every day instead of being greedy
User:
	I agree
Storyteller:
	Anne and I went down to Tsujiki fish market monday morning, which is the largest fish market in Asia. Lots of big fish there including tuna
User:
	Did you buy anything good?
Storyteller:
	I took plenty of photos and peered into lots of boxes which i'd never seen before. There was also pickled eels and live lobster and crabs. I didn't want anything because my stomach was aching
User:
	aww rhats too bad I bet it was fun to look
Storyteller:
	Before going onto the subway we stopped at a beautiful buddhist temple. Nice to get a breather before going home.
User:
	I bet it was nice to look at differnt items
Storyteller:
	Yeah it was a fantastic experience even though we had to get to the fish market at 630AM!
User:
	wow thats really early
Storyteller:
	A lion was sleeping but then a mouse woke it up. He was about to kill the mouse but the mouse pleaded for its life. The lion laughed and good-humoredly let it go. One day that lion got tangled in a net and the mouse set it free. Goes to show a mouse can help a lion.
User:
	Thats what you call loyal to a friend
Storyteller:
	Yes the mouse promised to repay the debt when the lion didn't eat it so ya know animals can be real honest about things too
User:
	yes they sure can
Storyteller:
	It's sad that the lion got caught into a hunter's net though. Poachers probably.
User:
	I'd say so and yes its sad that it happens period
Storyteller:
	Guess the Lion wasn't laughing anymore when the mouse came to save him
User:
	I am sure he wasnt
Storyteller:
	But lesson learned for the mouse because if you wake up a lion most of them will just eat you
User:
	So I have heard even though a mouse isnt much of a meal

====================
Storyteller:
	a friend of mine went to the flea market and bought a goose.
Storyteller:
	it was golden in hue and would lay eggs made of gold. my friend, selfish and greedy had the idea that the goose was actualy made of gold, or had gold inside. So, one day he took an ax and killed the goose thinking, "I will be rich."
Storyteller:
	Anyway, the goose was made of soft tissue and organs, so it died and my friend no longer had access to golden eggs,
Storyteller:
	click next, please.
Storyteller:
	once, there was a lion sleeping in his den. It was a quiet, languid day.
Storyteller:
	a mouse was scurrying across the dirt floor and sped across his face, startling the lion to awake.
Storyteller:
	Immediately, the lion swatted his paw out of anger, catching the mouse.
Storyteller:
	The mouse was scared and begged for his life. "One day I will save you, as insignificant as you think i am!"
Storyteller:
	Amused at the mouse's bravado, his bravery, the Lion let him and go, thinking that he would never see the rodent again.
Storyteller:
	One day, the lion was running across a field and was snatched by a poachers net. Scared, and resigned to his fate, the lion felt a mouse running back and forth across his back, gnawing at the ner.
Storyteller:
	When the net became free, the mouse smiled, "you laughed at me, but even the smallest of creatures can help a lion."
Storyteller:
	Click next please.
Storyteller:
	Our dog, benjamin, will only drink from a stainless steel bowl, so we keep one on our deck. It's become a popular spot for birds, squirrels and other woodland creatures
Storyteller:
	One day, a rather maniacal squirrel danced, spun and ran to the bowl. He was so startled that he stumbled, fell and had to clutch his little paw on the bowl to keep him from falling off the deck. I wish I had a camera to capture the look on is face.

User:

Storyteller:

	And afcourse in anger he planing just to smash her with his paw and claws.
Storyteller:
	Litle buddy got so terified that forgeting all selfrespect, started begging to spare her life;.
Storyteller:
	Hell knows maybe because lion was still sleepy, maybe because it was tuesday and he was in good mood, he spared her life.

Storyteller:
	And klike people telling, Karma exist and one day same lion, king of the jungles, got into the net left by hunters.
User:
	And then he begged for his life

	How is the buddhist temple next to the Hibaya line entrance different from other temples?
Storyteller:
	Let's start again.
Storyteller:
	Anne and I went to Tsujik Fish market early Monday morning and we tried to catch the early morning auction.
Storyteller:
	However, we missed it even though we got there by 6:30am.  We weren't the only ones missed it.  Too bad, Tsujiki is probably the largest fish market in the world.  At least we could see how fishes being transported away.  A huge tuna with tail cut off and stuffed in it's mouth to save space.  It was a really cramped space.
Storyteller:
	There were also fresh sushi and noodles.  I was tempted to have some sushi for breakfast, but it might not be a great idea for my tummy.  So, I opted for a cappucino and pastry instead.
Storyteller:
	On the way back to the subway station, we went to a beautiful Japanese templates in that the 'altar' area was very elaborately decorated.  It was nice to take a breather before jumping on the subway home.
Storyteller:
	There were a greedy couple who owned a Goose which laid a Golden egg every day.  Lucky though they were, they soon felt that they didn't get rich fast enough.  They imagined the bird must be made of gold inside and they decided to kill it to secure the whole store of gold inside the bird.  However, they soon realized the goose was just like any others goose.  Hence, they neither got rick all at once as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.
Storyteller:
	By the way, this is the second story.

	We keep a large bowl of water outside the back door for Benjamin to drink when he plays out there. He is not the only one though, birds lie up to drink and bathe in it, and squirrels also drink from it. This time the squirrel was crazy! It saw it's reflection and shocked himself so badly he flew back and fell off the deck! He was fine though and came back to look again, scaring himself once more!

	I went scuba diving on the great Barrier reef, it was incredible! I found it hard to get used to the maske and breathing through my mouth under water at first, it instills panic! But, I got used to it and was able to focus on the marine life. I saw so many great things, a giant clam that opened up as I touched it, beautiful pants that change color when touched. Some people on an earlier dive said they saw a shark which concerned me but I managed to get past that idea and do a second dive because it wasn't like I had seen it myself! On the boat ride back to Cairns we saw a group of whales, how mesmerizing! All this beauty on offer I wish I had longer in Australia to explore more

	My friend Anne and I went to see the early morning auction at the Tsujiki Fish Market one Monday morning.
Storyteller:
	The market takes up several kilometres and is one of the largest of its kind in the world !
Storyteller:
	Even though we arrived at 6:30 in the morning but unfortunately missed the auction.
Storyteller:
	There were many others in the same predicament who had gotten there even earlier and even they missed the auction.
User:
	What time did the auction start?
Storyteller:
	It seems that it is open only to those in the trade according to a guidebook.
Storyteller:
	Regardless, it was amazing to see how the market worked - so many wholesalers bring their wares to sell.
Storyteller:
	There were even some huge tuna !
Storyteller:
	The auction started at some time before we got there, we have no idea when.
Storyteller:
	So many delivery carts were speeding around so we took it as a sign to stay out of the way.
Storyteller:
	I took many pictures of compact tuna with their tails cut off and stuffed in their mouths to save space.
User:
	That sounds interesting.
Storyteller:
	It was really something to see
Storyteller:
	I also have pictures of exotic to me marine products that i could see in various boxes.
Storyteller:
	The many traders were performing cool and fascinating rituals that were so interesting to watch like scooping fish out of water tanks, tossing seafood across from stall to stall, prepare eels by skinning them.
Storyteller:
	There was a smaller market along the periphery that we also ivestigated.
User:
	How was that one?
Storyteller:
	It was quite diverse, selling things from veggies to special teas and even marine equipment.
Storyteller:
	They also had some stalls where they had sushi fresh off the boat and noodles - apparently the very freshest in Tokyo.
Storyteller:
	The lines began at 7:30 in the morning
User:
	Did you eat any of the fresh fish?
Storyteller:
	I considered have sushi for breakfast but opted instead for more traditional fare - a roadside cappucin0 and pastry.
Storyteller:
	I was afraid that my stomach wouldn't appreciate the early morning sushi.
Storyteller:
	On the way back to the subway we visited a gorgeous buddhist temple close to the entrance.
Storyteller:
	This one was different than others that I've seen in that it was very ornately decorated and not austere.
Storyteller:
	The atmosphere had a calming effect that we welcomed before hopping on the bustling metro.
User:
	Did you go inside?
Storyteller:
	Yes it was quite beautiful.
Storyteller:
	A man and wife were very fortunate to have a golden egg laying goose.
Storyteller:
	Of course they began to think that they weren't getting rich enough because the goose wasn't producing eggs quick enough.
Storyteller:
	So they killed it and cut it open, thinking that the goose must be made of gold inside.
User:
	Was is made of gold?
Storyteller:
	They believed that there was a store of gold inside the goose.
Storyteller:
	No unfortunately it was just like every other goose inside.
Storyteller:
	So they never got rich all at one time AND they no longer had a supply of golden eggs to tide them by.

	I am not seeing any of your messages
User:
	Where did you go?
Storyteller:
	I am here and wrote you a long message
Storyteller:
	I wrote a story about the Japanese fish market experience.
User:
	I wonder why  I cannot see it
Storyteller:
	I just finished reading about the scuba diving at the Great Barrier reef and was going to write to you about it
User:
	Did you do the scuba diving there?
Storyteller:
	Yes, it was wonderful
User:
	What did you see while doing it?
Storyteller:
	The best thing was the GIANT clam.  It even opened and closed it mouth
User:
	Oh wow. That had to be great. See any pearls in it?
Storyteller:
	No, it isn't that type of clam.  I didn't see any sharks but saw a group of whales on the boat ride back
User:
	Whales are such magnificent creatures. Something I have never seen personally.
Storyteller:
	I wish I lived at a place where I could see them often
User:
	So was this a type of excursion you went on?
Storyteller:
	Yes, scuba diving in the Great Barrier reef while I visit Australia
User:
	Were you there on vacation?
Storyteller:
	yes

	Nice. How long were you there?

	Not long enough, I only have one more week

	Vacations are never long enough. What types of fish did you see.
Storyteller:
	Can't even name them
User:
	Was the water clear enough to see lots of things?
Storyteller:
	Yes, I saw the color changing plants

	man and a women had it made by getting paid every day from a goose laying a golden egg for them.  That wasn't enough for them, they wanted to get rich quick so thought if cut the goose open they could be rich all at once. they cut the goose open and got nothing.

	Today I went scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef...Awesome doesn't even begin to describe it.
Storyteller:
	Not gonna lie when we first jumped into the water and I started breathing through the mouthpiece, I thought I was going to panic and not be able to do it because it was just that weird.
Storyteller:
	After getting a couple of meters down into the water, I adjusted and was able to focus on the reef instead of how I was breathing.
Storyteller:
	It's hands down one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
Storyteller:
	Scuba diving in and of itself is a cool experience, but throwing in the reef just made it all the more special.
Storyteller:
	I touched a GIANT clam and it opened and closed as I sort of petted it....there was this weird plant that changed colours when you touched it...it's just a wonderful and exotic place with so much activity.
Storyteller:
	Some people on my boat after my first dive said they had seen a shark...uh...that may have changed things for me.  Because I myself HADN'T seen a shark, I was able to convince myself to do my second afternoon dive.
Storyteller:
	On the boat ride back to Cairns, we also saw a group of whales.  Aaah, such majestic creatures.
Storyteller:
	I'm sad I only have less than a week left to explore Australia there's so much more I could do here if I only had tie!
Storyteller:
	This is one of those times I wish I had a digital camera.  We keep a large stainless steel bowl of water outside on the back deck for Benjamin to drink out of when he's playing outside.
Storyteller:
	His bowl has become a very popular site.
Storyteller:
	Throughout the day many birds drink out of it and bathe in it.
Storyteller:
	The birds literally line up on the railing and wait their turn.
Storyteller:
	Squirrels also come to drink out of it.
Storyteller:
	The craziest squirrel just came by- he was literally jumping in fright at what I believe was his own reflection in the bowl.
Storyteller:
	He was startled so much at one point that he leap in the air and fell off the deck.
Storyteller:
	But not quite, I saw his one little paw hanging on!
Storyteller:
	After a moment or two his paw slipped and he tumbled down a few feet.
Storyteller:
	But oh, if you could have seen the look on his startled face and how he jumped back each time he caught his reflection in the bowl!
Storyteller:
	This is the end of this story
Storyteller:
	It will not let me click next to go to the last story

Storyteller:
	A lion caught a mouse and was about to kill it when the mouse pleaded with the lion to let it go, the lion laughed but decided to let the mouse go free. Shortly after the lion was captured in a net, the mouse came across the lion and helped him free.
User:
	why did the mouse help the lion?
Storyteller:
	Because he promised to help him in return if ever he needed help if the lion let him go.
User:
	It's a good thing the lion let the mouse go then or he would still be in the net
Storyteller:
	Very true!
User:
	If you were the mouse, even though the lion tried to eat you previously and let u go would you still have helped the lion?
Storyteller:
	Yes, the lion was good enough to let me go so I guess I'd owe him.

====================
Storyteller:
	You heard this story before, a married couple had a goose that could lay golden eggs.
Storyteller:
	The problem was that they got one egg a day, and they weren't satisfied with that.
Storyteller:
	The couple agreed to kill and cut open the goose (believing it to be full of gold).
Storyteller:
	Once killed, the goose turned out to be a normal goose on the inside, and the greedy couple were worse off than when they started.
Storyteller:
	We keep a bowl of water out back for out dog to drink out of.
Storyteller:
	Occasionally, birds and other small animals will bathe and drink from it.
Storyteller:
	The strangest of these animals was a squirrel who came by to drink from the bowl.
Storyteller:
	He ended up being startled by his own reflection and fell over.
Storyteller:
	He fell two feet before he got a grip on something.
Storyteller:
	I wish I had a camera.
Storyteller:
	A Lion was sleeping in his lair.
Storyteller:
	A mouse has accidentally awoken him.
Storyteller:
	Angrily the lion seized the mouse with his paw and prepared to kill it.
Storyteller:
	The mouse begged for its life by promising to repay the lion for his mercy.
Storyteller:
	Amused at the concept that a lion would need a mouse's help, the lion let the mouse go.
Storyteller:
	One day the lion got trapped in a hunter's net, and the mouse heard the lion's frustrated roars.
Storyteller:
	The mouse was able to chew the ropes of the net apart so that the Lion could escape.

	Hello! Tell me your story
Storyteller:
	A lion was asleep in his lair and was awoken by a mouse running over his face
User:
	What did the lion do next?
Storyteller:
	He was about to kill the mouse but the mouse pleaded for his life and promised to repay his kindness. The lion laughed thinking that the mouse could never do anything to help him
User:
	How did the mouse respond?
Storyteller:
	He waited and one day his chance to assist the lion thereby showing even something can do something helpful.
User:
	How did he assist the lion?
Storyteller:
	He helped free the lion from a hunter's net.
User:
	How did the lion respond?
Storyteller:
	I don't know. The story doesn't say.
User:
	Alright, thank you. Please continue.
