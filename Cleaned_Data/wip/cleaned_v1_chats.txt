	Hi
Storyteller:
	On Monday morning me and Anne went down to the worlds biggest fish market, Tsujiki Fish market for the early morning auction. We got there at 6:30 am.m and we were too late because there were no signs posted in Romanji.
User:
	Im sorry you missed the fresh fish for the day. Perhaps you can learn some Romanji to Engoish words.
Storyteller:
	We weren't the only ones who were there either. Some people got there before we did and none of them made it to the auction either.
User:
	They must not have had much to sell
User:
	Perhaps go an hour earlier next time and you might get some fish.
Storyteller:
	According to the guidebook the auction is open to the trade. It was quite the experience to see hundreds of people with their goods, including tuna hauling them back and forth to sell. SOme of them had small delivery carts too. The tuna didn't have any tailed and they were in their mouths so they could save space.
User:
	Tuna are really large fish so i can see why they would need a cart to move them around
User:
	Did the market sell any special fish you hadnt heard of before?
User:
	Did you see and sushi chefs there buying the fresh fish for their restaurants? I bet they go there very early to get what they need for their sushi.
User:
	Is Anne your sister? Is she here for a visit?
User:
	I went to the fish market one time with my grandfather when I was a little girl. He carried me on his shoulders the entire time so my new suede boots didnt get a fishy smell .
Storyteller:
	I took a lot of pictures
User:
	You should post some of them so we can see what the market looks like today.

	Why did the cut the goose open?
User:
	I dont know why did they?
Storyteller:
	They thought they would get a lot of gold
User:
	Did they find any?
Storyteller:
	No it was just like any other goose sadly
User:
	oh thats sad
Storyteller:
	Yeah they should have just accepted one golden egg every day instead of being greedy
User:
	I agree
Storyteller:
	Anne and I went down to Tsujiki fish market monday morning, which is the largest fish market in Asia. Lots of big fish there including tuna
User:
	Did you buy anything good?
Storyteller:
	I took plenty of photos and peered into lots of boxes which i'd never seen before. There was also pickled eels and live lobster and crabs. I didn't want anything because my stomach was aching
User:
	aww rhats too bad I bet it was fun to look
Storyteller:
	Before going onto the subway we stopped at a beautiful buddhist temple. Nice to get a breather before going home.
User:
	I bet it was nice to look at differnt items
Storyteller:
	Yeah it was a fantastic experience even though we had to get to the fish market at 630AM!
User:
	wow thats really early
Storyteller:
	A lion was sleeping but then a mouse woke it up. He was about to kill the mouse but the mouse pleaded for its life. The lion laughed and good-humoredly let it go. One day that lion got tangled in a net and the mouse set it free. Goes to show a mouse can help a lion.
User:
	Thats what you call loyal to a friend
Storyteller:
	Yes the mouse promised to repay the debt when the lion didn't eat it so ya know animals can be real honest about things too
User:
	yes they sure can
Storyteller:
	It's sad that the lion got caught into a hunter's net though. Poachers probably.
User:
	I'd say so and yes its sad that it happens period
Storyteller:
	Guess the Lion wasn't laughing anymore when the mouse came to save him
User:
	I am sure he wasnt
Storyteller:
	But lesson learned for the mouse because if you wake up a lion most of them will just eat you
User:
	So I have heard even though a mouse isnt much of a meal

User:
	Terrified of what ?
Storyteller:
	Of beeing able to breath such a small amount of air and all uncomon feeling and magnitude of nature.
Storyteller:
	But latter it bocome one of my greatest experiences in life.
Storyteller:
	I was able to touch giant clam and can swear it opens and closes like saying Hi to me.
User:
	Bet you had a great time
Storyteller:
	It was superb, other people on the boat even made fun of me by teloling that its shark behind me.

Storyteller:
	And by the same logic you can quess what?
User:
	What’s that ?
Storyteller:
	Thay was thinking that bird is made of gold inside. If you lay gold means you golden inside.
User:
	Ok
Storyteller:
	And litle by litle they decided to stash all gold at one go and cut poor animal open...
User:
	Very greedy
Storyteller:
	but inside, goose was just ordinary goose and not made of gold.
Storyteller:
	Can imagine they surprise when they was left without gold and bird?

Storyteller:
	Maybe you know it, about mouse and the lion?
User:
	 I think I’ve heaard it but can’t remeber at the minute
Storyteller:
	I will try to recall it for you.
Storyteller:
	So, a lion was resting at his liar, when suddenly he was woken up by feeling that something running over his face.
Storyteller:
	Must agree not the best felling to be woken up.
User:
	No I bet
Storyteller:
	So in result he finds mice .
Storyteller:
	And afcourse in anger he planing just to smash her with his paw and claws.
Storyteller:
	Litle buddy got so terified that forgeting all selfrespect, started begging to spare her life;.
Storyteller:
	Hell knows maybe because lion was still sleepy, maybe because it was tuesday and he was in good mood, he spared her life.
User:
	That’s good
Storyteller:
	And klike people telling, Karma exist and one day same lion, king of the jungles, got into the net left by hunters.
User:
	And then he begged for his life
Storyteller:
	MOst people will be happy hearing lion roars in the vain, but our litle buddy recognized that roar and run towards that side.
Storyteller:
	And instead of making fun, troling and buly lion.
Storyteller:
	You will not believe, she jumped to the net and started gnaw ropes.
Storyteller:
	After couple moments and some minutes, lion was free again.
User:
	Cool
Storyteller:
	Then she just smioled and told, now you see that even smallest creature one day can save lion.
Storyteller:
	So no matter how small you are, it matters what big jobs you done.
User:

Storyteller:
	Nice moral in my opinion.

	A man and wife had a golose that laid golden eggs, it would lay one every day but they thought they could get richer by cutting open the goose to get the gold inside. However there was no gold inside the goose
User:
	So they killed the goose?
User:
	How sad
Storyteller:
	We keep a large bowl of water outside the back door for Benjamin to drink when he plays out there. He is not the only one though, birds lie up to drink and bathe in it, and squirrels also drink from it. This time the squirrel was crazy! It saw it's reflection and shocked himself so badly he flew back and fell off the deck! He was fine though and came back to look again, scaring himself once more!
Storyteller:
	I went scuba diving on the great Barrier reef, it was incredible! I found it hard to get used to the maske and breathing through my mouth under water at first, it instills panic! But, I got used to it and was able to focus on the marine life. I saw so many great things, a giant clam that opened up as I touched it, beautiful pants that change color when touched. Some people on an earlier dive said they saw a shark which concerned me but I managed to get past that idea and do a second dive because it wasn't like I had seen it myself! On the boat ride back to Cairns we saw a group of whales, how mesmerizing! All this beauty on offer I wish I had longer in Australia to explore more

	My friend Anne and I went to see the early morning auction at the Tsujiki Fish Market one Monday morning.
Storyteller:
	The market takes up several kilometres and is one of the largest of its kind in the world !
Storyteller:
	Even though we arrived at 6:30 in the morning but unfortunately missed the auction.
Storyteller:
	There were many others in the same predicament who had gotten there even earlier and even they missed the auction.
User:
	What time did the auction start?
Storyteller:
	It seems that it is open only to those in the trade according to a guidebook.
Storyteller:
	Regardless, it was amazing to see how the market worked - so many wholesalers bring their wares to sell.
Storyteller:
	There were even some huge tuna !
Storyteller:
	The auction started at some time before we got there, we have no idea when.
Storyteller:
	So many delivery carts were speeding around so we took it as a sign to stay out of the way.
Storyteller:
	I took many pictures of compact tuna with their tails cut off and stuffed in their mouths to save space.
User:
	That sounds interesting.
Storyteller:
	It was really something to see
Storyteller:
	I also have pictures of exotic to me marine products that i could see in various boxes.
Storyteller:
	The many traders were performing cool and fascinating rituals that were so interesting to watch like scooping fish out of water tanks, tossing seafood across from stall to stall, prepare eels by skinning them.
Storyteller:
	There was a smaller market along the periphery that we also ivestigated.
User:
	How was that one?
Storyteller:
	It was quite diverse, selling things from veggies to special teas and even marine equipment.
Storyteller:
	They also had some stalls where they had sushi fresh off the boat and noodles - apparently the very freshest in Tokyo.
Storyteller:
	The lines began at 7:30 in the morning
User:
	Did you eat any of the fresh fish?
Storyteller:
	I considered have sushi for breakfast but opted instead for more traditional fare - a roadside cappucin0 and pastry.
Storyteller:
	I was afraid that my stomach wouldn't appreciate the early morning sushi.
Storyteller:
	On the way back to the subway we visited a gorgeous buddhist temple close to the entrance.
Storyteller:
	This one was different than others that I've seen in that it was very ornately decorated and not austere.
Storyteller:
	The atmosphere had a calming effect that we welcomed before hopping on the bustling metro.
User:
	Did you go inside?
Storyteller:
	Yes it was quite beautiful.
Storyteller:
	A man and wife were very fortunate to have a golden egg laying goose.
Storyteller:
	Of course they began to think that they weren't getting rich enough because the goose wasn't producing eggs quick enough.
Storyteller:
	So they killed it and cut it open, thinking that the goose must be made of gold inside.
User:
	Was is made of gold?
Storyteller:
	They believed that there was a store of gold inside the goose.
Storyteller:
	No unfortunately it was just like every other goose inside.
Storyteller:
	So they never got rich all at one time AND they no longer had a supply of golden eggs to tide them by.

	Yes, it was wonderful
User:
	What did you see while doing it?
Storyteller:
	The best thing was the GIANT clam.  It even opened and closed it mouth
User:
	Oh wow. That had to be great. See any pearls in it?
Storyteller:
	No, it isn't that type of clam.  I didn't see any sharks but saw a group of whales on the boat ride back
User:
	Whales are such magnificent creatures. Something I have never seen personally.
Storyteller:
	I wish I lived at a place where I could see them often
User:
	So was this a type of excursion you went on?
Storyteller:
	Yes, scuba diving in the Great Barrier reef while I visit Australia
User:
	Were you there on vacation?
Storyteller:
	yes
User:
	Nice. How long were you there?
Storyteller:
	Not long enough, I only have one more week
User:
	Vacations are never long enough. What types of fish did you see.
Storyteller:
	Can't even name them
User:
	Was the water clear enough to see lots of things?
Storyteller:
	Yes, I saw the color changing plants
User:
	Sounds like you had a wonderful experience. Good for you

	A lion caught a mouse and was about to kill it when the mouse pleaded with the lion to let it go, the lion laughed but decided to let the mouse go free. Shortly after the lion was captured in a net, the mouse came across the lion and helped him free.
User:
	why did the mouse help the lion?
Storyteller:
	Because he promised to help him in return if ever he needed help if the lion let him go.
User:
	It's a good thing the lion let the mouse go then or he would still be in the net
Storyteller:
	Very true!
User:
	If you were the mouse, even though the lion tried to eat you previously and let u go would you still have helped the lion?
