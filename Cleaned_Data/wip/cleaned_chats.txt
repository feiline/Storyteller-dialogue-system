User:
	how's your evening going so far?
User:
	Anyone listening to me?
Storyteller:
	Here is the story: A man and his wife had a goose that laid a golden egg every day.
User:
	Oh wow, that would be cool!  I would like that goose.
Storyteller:
	They started thinking they weren't getting rich fast enough
User:
	that's not cool. That's greedy.
Storyteller:
	Thinking the goose was made of gold inside, they decided to kill it to get all the gold at once
User:
	Oh my gosh. How horrifying!!!  They are wicked people.
Storyteller:
	Once they cut it open they realized it was just like any other goose
User:
	Oh crap. Goes to show you greed is the root of all evil.
Storyteller:
	So they no longer were able to get the golden eggs
Storyteller:
	the end
User:
	Serves them right.
Storyteller:
	Okay, second story is about someone who went scuba diving on the great barrier reef
User:
	I would like to go scuba diving
Storyteller:
	they thought they would panic at first but adjusted after the first couple meters
Storyteller:
	they were then able to focus on the reef instead of how they were breathing
Storyteller:
	it was one of the most amazing experiences of their life
Storyteller:
	they saw a giant clam that opened and closed when they touched it
User:
	Scuba diving is scary. I would be cautious too.
Storyteller:
	there was also a plant that changed colors when they touched it
User:
	Cool.  Would be amazing!
Storyteller:
	some people they were with said they saw a shark but they didn't
User:
	The ocean is so full of mysterious things, wonder, powerful.
Storyteller:
	on the boat ride back they saw a group of whales
User:
	That would be scary to encounter.
User:
	Oh wow. the whales would be fun to see. Huge animals.
Storyteller:
	they wished they had more time to spend in australia since there is much more they would like to do there
User:
	Oh you know it. Travel needs to be a full time job.
Storyteller:
	so that's the end of that story, there isn't a third one
User:
	Ah, your stories were good. Can you think of another?
Storyteller:
	no, there are only the two

User:
	hi please tell me your story
User:
	hello?
User:
	are you there?
Storyteller:
	The birds and squirrels like to drink out of it
Storyteller:
	The staainless steel water bowl in the garden
User:
	do any other animals drink out of it?
Storyteller:
	It is Benjamins bowl
User:
	who is benjamin?
Storyteller:
	Benjamin is our pet who likes to play in the garden
User:
	what sort of animal is benjamin?
Storyteller:
	He is a dog
User:
	oh lovely, how old is he?
Storyteller:
	He likes to watch the squirrels, one jumped with fright when he saw his reflection in the bowl.
User:
	does benjamin chase squirrels?
Storyteller:
	I think he prefers to watch them, the one that jumped with fright ended up hanging on with one paw.
User:
	did the squirrel fall?
Storyteller:
	Yes he let go and tumbled down a few feet, he had a very startled expression each time he saw his reflection in the bowl.
User:
	did he go back the bowl after falling? And scared himself again?
Storyteller:
	Yes he kept going back to the bowl and seeing his reflection and kept jumping back each time he saw it.
User:
	how cute!

====================
Storyteller:
	Today I went scuba diving on the Great Barrier Ref...AWESOME doesn't even begin to describe it.
User:
	I would like to go too
Storyteller:
	Not gonna lie, when we first jumped into the water and I started breathing through the mouthpiece, I though I was going to panic and not be able to do it because it was just that weird.
Storyteller:
	After getting a couple of meters down into the water, I adjusted and was able to focus on the reef instead of how I was breathing
User:
	it must be an awesome experience
Storyteller:
	It's hands down one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
Storyteller:
	Scuba diving in and of itself is a cool experience, but throwing in the reef just made it all that more special.
User:
	I envy you
Storyteller:
	I touched a GIANT clam and it opened and closed as I sort of petted it...there was this weird plant that changed colours when you touched it...it's just a wonderful and exotic place with so much activity.
User:
	I have to go with you some day
Storyteller:
	Some people on my boat after my first dive said they had seen a shark...uh...that may have changed things for me.  Because I myself HADN'T seen a shark, I was able to convince myself to do my second afternoon dive.
Storyteller:
	On the boat ride back to Cairns, we also saw a group of whales.  Aaah, such majestic creatures.  I'm sad I only have less than a week left to explore Australia, there's so much more I could do here if I only had time!
User:
	that must have been scary
Storyteller:
	Next story
Storyteller:
	A man and his wife had the good fortune to possess a Good which laid a Golden Egg every day
User:
	that is my dream haha
Storyteller:
	Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once.
Storyteller:
	But when they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose.
User:
	le me tell you.... that was stupid
Storyteller:
	Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.
Storyteller:

Storyteller:
	That is my last story...
User:
	ok
User:
	it was interesting and fun to read your stories

====================
User:
	hey there
Storyteller:
	hi
User:
	I'm listening
Storyteller:
	So today I went diving at the Great Barrier Reef
Storyteller:
	We went scuba diving there.  At first it was pretty scary but once I called down I was able to see the beautiful reef.
Storyteller:
	I was able to touch a clam and a plant that changed colors.  There were other people there that said they saw a shark!
Storyteller:
	I saw some whales on the boat ride back as well
User:
	that must have been scarey
Storyteller:
	yea I was pretty scared when people said they saw a shark.   I didn't see it though so It was ok for me
User:
	what kind of whales did you see?
Storyteller:
	Oh I'm not quite sure what kind they were. They were large and black.  Might have been humpback but I'm not sure
User:
	still exciting to see I'm sure
Storyteller:
	Yea it was amazing
Storyteller:
	I guess I'm done with this story
User:
	you did well
Storyteller:
	Have you heard the story about the Lion and the mouse?
User:
	yes, but I enjoy hearting it again
User:
	hearing that is
Storyteller:
	Once upon a time there was a Lion that caught a mouse running over his face.
Storyteller:
	The Lion had the mouse in his paws and was about to kill it when the mouse shouted, "Please let me go, one day I may be able to repay your kindness"
Storyteller:
	The Lion thought that was so funny cuz how could a mouse ever help a lion, but since he was entertained he let the mouse go anyways
Storyteller:
	Then one day, the Lion got caught in a hunter's net.  He couldn't get out, but that's when the mouse came out
Storyteller:
	The mouse nibbled through the rope and was able to free the Lion.  He said, "see? i told you I could repay you!"
Storyteller:
	What do you think the moral of that story was?
User:
	always be friendly as you never know who may help you or how
Storyteller:
	Do you think that's a good way to live?  To only help people because they may be able to help you later?
User:
	no, not saying that, but no need to make enemies
Storyteller:
	Do you think the lion made a good choice in letting the mouse live?
User:
	yes, the mouse seemed genuine in his emotion and did keep his promise
Storyteller:
	Well I guess I am done with this story too.  Thank you for listening!
User:
	I enjoyed listening to you

====================
User:
	i'm ready to listen
Storyteller:
	I once heard of a married couple who were lucky enough to own a Goose who laid a golden egg every day.
User:
	tell me more
Storyteller:
	But true to human nature, they weren't quite happy with the rate at which they were accumulating their wealth. They suspected that the bird must be made of gold on the inside. Go figure!
User:
	did they kill the bird?
Storyteller:
	Yes, suprisingly they did! And do you know what they found once they cut it open?
User:
	golden eggs
User:
	what happened next?
Storyteller:
	Good guess. But no! They found the the bird was just like any other goose. So not only did they not get rich as they hoped, they landed up losing out on the daily golden egg. A lot can be learned from this lesson, don't you think?
User:
	yes , tell me another story
User:
	do you have another story to tell?
Storyteller:
	I sure do!
User:
	tell me
Storyteller:
	There once was a lion asleep in his lair. He was suddenly woken up by a mouse who ran over his face!
Storyteller:
	As you can imagine, the lion lost his temper and grabbed the mouse with his paw.
User:
	then what happened
User:
	what happened to the mouse
Storyteller:
	Well the mouse pleaded for it's life of course! "Please let me go, and one day I'll repay you for your kindness", it cried!
User:
	did the lion let him go?
Storyteller:
	He did indeed! This amused the lion so much (coming from such an insignificant creature) that he even laughed out loud.
User:
	and then what
Storyteller:
	Would you believe, some time later, the lion found himself tangled up in a hunters net?
User:
	did the mouse help him?
Storyteller:
	Wellâ€¦ the mouse happened to hear the lion's roars of anger and ran to assist him
User:
	go on
User:
	did he save the lion?
Storyteller:
	He began gnawing on on the ropes and before long, the lion was set free. "There, you laughed at me when I promised to set you free. Now you can see that even a small mouse like me can help a lion". A great lesson to be learnt, don't you think?
User:
	a great lesson
User:
	do you have one more story before i go?
------------------------------------------------------------


Chat: 7
====================
User:
	Hello
Storyteller:
	Here is the first story
User:
	ok
Storyteller:
	A lion was asleep in his lair when woken up by a mouse running over his face. The lion lost his temper and was about to kill the mouse when the mouse begged him to spare its life.
User:
	Ooh, I wonder what happened next. Did the lion spare the mouse?
Storyteller:
	The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let the mouse go.
Storyteller:
	The mouse had promised to repay the lion for its kindness.
User:
	That's quite cool. Did the mouse manage to repay the lion?
Storyteller:
	One day the lion became entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before too long in setting the lion free.
User:
	That's a nice story, there seems to be some kind of moral there. Where did you hear about it?
Storyteller:
	It's the story I'm supposed to tell you from this task. Now moving onto the next one.
User:
	ok
Storyteller:
	A Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid a Golden Egg every day.
User:
	That's lucky!
Storyteller:
	Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once.
User:
	I would think that wouldn't turn out so well. What happened?
Storyteller:
	When they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose. Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.
User:
	I think they were just a bit too greedy....these tales are filled with morals, aren't they? What's your last tale?
Storyteller:
	That's the last one. Thank you for listening!

====================
User:
	Tell me your story :)
Storyteller:
	A sleepng lion was woken by a mouse and the lion was going to kill the mouse, but the mouse told the lion that if he was spared he would help when the lion needed it. The lion thought it funny and let the mouse go. When the lion got trapped in a net, the mouse gnawed through the netting a repayed the lion by saving its life
User:
	Wowsers, clever mouse, is that the end or did something else happen?
Storyteller:
	No that was the end, there is a moral to the story
User:
	And the moral is?
Storyteller:
	thet no matter how mighty you are someone you think is nothing can help you
User:
	Depressing moral!
User:
	Is there another story?
Storyteller:
	I don't think it depressing. Inspirational. There is another story, do you want to hear it?
User:
	Yes, I'm up for another story.
Storyteller:
	OK. A man and his wife owned a goose that lay golden eggs. They became greedy and thinking that the goose was full of eggs decided to kill it and get all the eggs at once. But when they killed it, it turned out to be just a normal goose. So they did not get all the eggsa and didn't any in the future. It's an old story with a moral again
User:
	Yes, I know the story well. I think on it now and I know the lion story too, only it wasn't a net he had a thorn in his paw. I guess these stories can be told many ways
Storyteller:
	You are right, I remember it as being a thorn in his paw too
User:
	I misread what you typed originally, you're right it's an inspiration story not depressing at all! lol, silly me!
Storyteller:
	Maybe that is part of a moralistic story, that it has to be thouht about and sometimes explained.
User:
	Probably. All these stories originally would be told orally, so they would change a little bit from teller to teller, like Chinese Whispers - we knew the thorn story, the person who wrote this task knew it as a net
Storyteller:
	Yeah, although I think the net is more modern and perhaps makes the story better

Storyteller:
	Hello
Storyteller:
	A sleeping lion was woken up by a mouse running over his face. Losing his temper, the lion grabbed it with his and was going to kill it.
User:
	oh my what happened next?
Storyteller:
	The mouse begged the lion to not kill it, promising to repay his kindness.
User:
	Did the lion kill it?
Storyteller:
	No. The lion laughed thinking that the mouse could never do anything to help him. But he laughed aloud and allowed the mouse to go free.
User:
	Wow what a good deed, the mouse must have been thrilled
Storyteller:
	One day though, the lion had gotten trapped in net. The mouse came along and was able to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, setting the lion free.
User:
	That mouse ended up helping the lion? That's an incredible coincidence
Storyteller:
	Which showed even though the mouse was small, he was able to help the lion. The end
User:
	What a great story, great moral to teach kids as well. You got any other stories?
Storyteller:
	Yes
Storyteller:
	On Monday morning, a friend and I went to Tsujiki fish market for an early morning auction. Tsujiki is the largest fish market in Asia.
User:
	Cool, did you buy any fish? I've never been to an auction like that before
Storyteller:
	No we just looked. The auction itself is only to trade people.
User:
	oh i see. Well what else did you do that day?
Storyteller:
	It was a very interesting experience seeing all the different varities of fish and sea creatures.
Storyteller:
	We watched people prepare the different sea food to sell
Storyteller:
	There where also other stalls where you could get other products such as noodles or sushi.
User:
	Sounds like a fun day, I'm jealous as i did very little on Monday
User:

	Too bad this isn't set up to send pictures because I would have some good ones. We have this big stainless steel bowl set up for our dog to use as a drinking bowl when he's outside and the birds have taken over.
User:
	Well, it's a shame, but maybe you can describe it to me.
Storyteller:
	They're lined up on the deck railing and everything waiting for their turn to either get a drink or a bath. Probably a good thing they seem patient.
User:
	Hey, that sounds good, it sure gives you a great view.
Storyteller:
	And there was a squirrel that dropped by too, and kept getting scared by his reflection. He jumped back and slid a few feet down the side of the deck once he was so startled. It was so funny!
Storyteller:
	I've got another story too.
User:
	maybe you could show me some example through a link, I can surely get something like that in the market places
User:
	another story, please tell me
Storyteller:
	I wish I could
Storyteller:
	I head
User:
	that hurts, that is not possible.
User:
	but good tell me the other story, I'm anxious.
Storyteller:
	I heard this story about a mouse and a lion. This mouse ran into a lion's den and right across his face.
Storyteller:
	The lion was upset and caught the mouse but the mouse said if he was freed he would help the lion one day. The lion thought the idea of a mouse helping a lion was funny so he let the mouse go

Storyteller:
	Anne and I went to the Tsujiki Fish market on Monday morning for the early morning auction.  This market is the largest fish market in Asia possibly in the world.
Storyteller:
	However, we were still not early enough to catch the auction.
Storyteller:
	We did see a lot of activities after the auction and it was so crowded.  One funny scene was that the buyer tried to move the big tuna away.  They had the tuna tails cut off and stuffed into their mouths to save space in the cramped market.
Storyteller:
	I was tempted to have sushi for breakfast but I chose to skip this for my tummy's sake.  I ended up picked up some roadside pastry and cappucino instead.
Storyteller:
	On my way back to the subway, we went into a beautiful buddhist temple right beside the Hibaya line entrance.  This was quite different to many other Japanese temples in that the 'altar' area was very detailed decorated.  It was nice to take a breather before getting back on the subway.
User:
	i am listening
User:
	what inspired you most about the temple
User:
	what was your favorite fish you ate
Storyteller:
	The decoration at the altar area.
Storyteller:
	I didn't eat any fish at the market this morning.  I was worried about my tummy might not react well to the raw fish in the morning
User:
	right so instead what did you have
Storyteller:
	I had some roadside cappucino and pastry instead
User:
	what happened after the subway ride
Storyteller:
	I went back to the hotel
User:
	was that the end of your trip?
Storyteller:
	for the day
User:
	what happened the next day
Storyteller:
	I went  scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef which was my first scuba diving.
Storyteller:
	At first, I thought I was going to panic and not able to do it.  After getting a couple of meters down into the water, I adjusted and was able to focus on the reef instead of how I was breathing.
Storyteller:
	It was an amazing experience.  I touched a GIANT clam and it opened and closed.
User:
	that sounds scary. i would not be able to do that as i am chlostrophobic. you are lucky you could experience something so amazing
Storyteller:
	After the dive, someone on the boat told me they had seen a shark!!
User:
	did u find a pearl
Storyteller:
	I didn't
User:
	was it expensive
Storyteller:
	Yes

User:
	Are you going to start your story?
Storyteller:
	 I had an incredible experience scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef today.
Storyteller:
	I was nervous at first, but quickly got the breathing down correctly.  I actually touched a giant clam and it opened and closed.  A few people on my boat claimed to have seen a shark but thankfully I didn't.
User:
	Wow!
Storyteller:
	I convinced myself to dive again in the afternoon, shark or no shark.
Storyteller:
	We saw some whales on the boat ride back to Cairns.
Storyteller:
	I wish I had more than a week to explore Australia.  There is much more that I really wanted to see.
User:
	Did you get a chance to see much underwater?
Storyteller:
	Yes.  my favorite was this weird plant that seemed to change colors when I touched it.
Storyteller:
	Second story:
Storyteller:
	A man and his wife actually had a goose that laid golden eggs, every day in fact.
Storyteller:
	However they thought they could become richer faster thinking that the goose was made of gold inside.
User:
	Huh, wouldn't that be nice to have?
Storyteller:
	That would make life very interesting.
User:
	Did they ever manage to collect enough gold to be rich at any point?
Storyteller:
	Well no.  The couple thought they could access the entire amount of gold at once so they killed the goose.
User:
	Ah. What a shame
Storyteller:
	Not good because when they went inside the bird, it was just like any other goose.
Storyteller:
	I agree.
Storyteller:
	They didn't get rich immediately as they had hoped.
User:
	Instead they ate goose for one day when they could have had steak everyday
Storyteller:
	And they no longer enjoyed the golden eggs delivered by this goose on a daily basis.
Storyteller:
	This is true.
Storyteller:
	Unfortunately they became too greedy and should have stuck with their daily present.
Storyteller:
	I'm not sure what I would do with such a blessing.  How about yourself?
User:
	I would treat the goose like royalty
Storyteller:
	That makes sense to me.
Storyteller:
	Thank you so much for listening
User:
	Well you are a good storyteller.
Storyteller:
	Thanks so much!

====================
Storyteller:
	There was once a husband and wife who, through much good luck, had a very special goose.
Storyteller:
	Each day, the goose laid one golden egg. The husband and wife, growing impatient with their daily gold egg, decided that the goose must be made of gold.
Storyteller:
	So, in order to get rich faster and not have to wait each day for a new egg, they decided to kill the goose, assuming it would be made completely of gold on the inside.
Storyteller:
	Alas, the goose was just a goose on the inside! They killed the poor goose and now would no longer have a golden egg each day, nor a goose to lay it.
Storyteller:
	One day, deep in the jungle, a lion was sleeping soundly when suddenly it was awakened by a mouse who ran over it's face.
User:
	there are mouses in the jungle?
Storyteller:
	There is at least one mouse in this particular jungle. 
Storyteller:
	Angrily, the lion grabbed the mouse with its paw and was just about to kill it when the mouse begged for its life and promised to repay the lion if he let him go.
Storyteller:
	The lion laughed at the mouse, unsure that it could ever do anything to help him, but decided to let the mouse go anyway.
User:
	they can talk?
Storyteller:
	Of course, all animals can talk.
User:
	even across species?
Storyteller:
	One day, as the lion was walking, he got caught in a net set by hunters.
Storyteller:
	Yes, only humans are incapable of interspecies communications.
User:
	ok go on
Storyteller:
	The lion roared and roared, begging for help. The mouse, recognizing that roar, ran to the lion's rescue.
Storyteller:
	The mouse gnawed the ropes with his sharp rodent teeth and freed the lion.
Storyteller:
	"See?" said the mouse. "Just as promised. Even a little mouse can help a great big lion."
User:
	why didnt the lion bite the net
Storyteller:
	The lion was in a panic and wasn't thinking clearly.

User:
	hello
Storyteller:
	Hi there!
Storyteller:
	Ok so I have to retell a story . . .
User:
	ok
Storyteller:
	The story is that a couple keeps a dish of water outside for their pet when he's out there playing and one day they looked out and noticed several animals using the water. Birds were bathing in it, squirrels came up for a drink, and one squirrel even got startled by his reflection in the water and almost fell off the deck but managed to hold on.
User:
	I  bet that was funny to see
User:
	they should put out a bigger bowl
Storyteller:
	The next story is about a married couple who have a goose which lays a golden egg every day. Tired of waiting everyday to get their fortune, they wanted to get rich faster so decided to kill the goose and cut it open for a bunch of gold all at once. However when they cut it open, it was just a regular goose so they didn't get rich faster and now they didn't get richer day by day either.
Storyteller:
	Hahaha I know I would have loved to have seen that! I love animals.
User:
	poor goose  it did nothing wrong and lost its life for the greed of people
Storyteller:
	That was my exact same thought. People are never satisfied with what is already good in their life.
User:
	I bet they blamed the goose for their misfortune
Storyteller:
	I'm sure they did!
Storyteller:
	I definitely liked the first story better, it was much happier.
User:
	I agree
Storyteller:
	Isn't there a children's story called The Goose That Laid The Golden Egg? This must be a darker version of that.
User:
	I wonder how the people in the first story watched the animals with out scaring them.
User:
	  There is a story about the Golden egg  I think part of it is included in the Jack and the Beanstalk story
Storyteller:
	I live out in the country and we have all kinds of animals . . deer, raccoons, bunnies, you name it. We just watch them through our deck and porch doors.
User:
	I think I have seen a micky mouse cartoon with it too. They did not kill the goose in that one.
Storyteller:
	Oh ok I thought it sounded familiar.
Storyteller:
	Yeah I would hope not!
User:
	bunnies are so cute till they eat your garden.
Storyteller:
	This is very true! We actually have more trouble with the deer. They even eat our flowers.
Storyteller:
	Ok I think we can click on "End Experiment" now on the top left.
User:
	sure nice talking to you
Storyteller:
	Thanks, you too!
